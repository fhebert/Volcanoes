    "# Kaggle competition : INGV - Volcanic Eruption Prediction \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook summarizes the steps I followed for my submission to the INGV Kaggle competition, with which I achieved a top 25% position in the final ranking.\n",
    "I mainly compared tree ensembling methods and neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main problem of the competition is the following : we have a sample consisting of a great number of volcanoes. Ten sensors are disposed around each volcano.\n",
    "Each sensor records the seismic activity on a given period of time. For each volcano, we thus have a matrix of ten columns, each one being a time series corresponding\n",
    "to the activity recorded by the volcano. We also have the remaining time before next eruption. Using the ten time series, we aim at predicting the remaining time before\n",
    "next eruption. The metric used for evaluation is the mean absolute error (MAE).\n",
    "For more information, see here : https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-volcanic-eruptions-ingv-oe/overview\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the code below, don't forget to download the files attached with this notebook (X.csv and Y.csv) and place them in a clearly identified\n",
    "directory. Then, change the paths to these files accordingly in the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning algorithms cannot be straightforwardly applied on the given data. We first have to perform some feature extraction. Three functions are introduced below :\n",
    "\n",
    "- ListFiles: this function takes as argument a directory and lists all the csv files present in this directory. \n",
    "  It then returns a list containing all csv corresponding to volcanoes, a list containing the id's of the volcanoes \n",
    "  and a DataFrame corresponding to the train.csv file.\n",
    "- FeatureExtraction: this function takes as argument a DataFrame containing sensor data, and extracts features from it. \n",
    "  We aim at summarizing efficiently the information contained in the sensor data. The extracted features are namely \n",
    "  the mean, standard deviation, max, quantiles, skewness and kurtosis of each sensor. The positions of the \n",
    "  maximum and minimum values are also extracted.\n",
    "- ImportData: this function takes as arguments a directory containing the csv files corresponding to each volcano, and \n",
    "  the file containing the response variable. It then performs the extraction of features on each csv files corresponding \n",
    "  to a volcano. It finally returns a DataFrame containing the extracted features for each volcano, and another \n",
    "  DataFrame containing the id's and the remaining time to eruption (the response variable)."
